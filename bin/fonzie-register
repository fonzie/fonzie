  fonzie register anthonyshort/stitch-grid

This would mean that the server really just stores a list of github repos
that have registered to be packages. It could stored the JSON of the component
on the server so it could return the name, description, author quicker. This
would mean the server would need some way of refreshing a package.

By calling register on the package again it will re-sync the package.
